This is a small Project of mine build an Appoinment-Calendar System for your shell. It will be able to store different Appointments, sort those and List them in various way's. 


I used CMake to build the project, so in order to compile it properly you'd need CMake V.3.0 and above.
Then add execution right to the build.sh file and execute it. after that you should find a build folder with an executable in it.


Enjoy!
